Project Overview:

This project focuses on creating three unique animated buttons using CSS


Design Choices:

My design choices were all random Just trying out different animations and colors to try make the buttons as intereactive as possible.

Challenges:

One of the biggest challenges I faced was getting the box shadows to look good together. It took some trial and error to find the right combination of offsets, blur radii, and colors to create a beautiful effect.


Another challenge was getting the pink line to scale correctly on the 3rd button. I had to use a combination of width and transition properties to get the line to scale smoothly and correctly.

Features I'm Proud Of:

I am mostly proud of Button 3. With the button Animation Showcase by CodeSpace Academy on codepen used for inspiration on this button I played around alot with different effects to just try and create my own animation without using complex funtionalities.
